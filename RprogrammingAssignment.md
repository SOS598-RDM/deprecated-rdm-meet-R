# Assignment: R programming and peer review

There are two options (A and B) for the R programming assignment, please complete only one of the two options. Both options include a peer-review component. For both options, after uploading your file(s) to your GitHub repository on the course GitHub Organization, create an issue with the title "mark programming assignment last_name first_name", and mention (@srearl) in the body of the message so that I am alerted when your assignment has been submitted. We will assign peer-reviews after the assignment due date.

### Option A.

Address a simple analysis (statistical, plot) of a small piece of your research data or data related to your research using R. Your assignment should include your R code in a Rmd file, and a knitted version of the Rmd file in PDF format that includes enough information that readers will understand the data and the analysis that you are addressing. Upload all files (Rmd, PDF, data) to your GitHub repository in the course GitHub Organization using the naming convention: programming_lastName.fileExtension (e.g., programming_Earl.Rmd, programming_Earl.PDF, programming_earl.csv). 

Grading criteria:

1. functioning, well-documented code in a Rmd file that ingests data, and addresses an analysis or generates a plot of the data 
2. output of the Rmd file in PDF format with sufficient detail for a reader to understand the data and analysis
3. the raw data used in the analysis (so that others can run the code)


### Option B.

Using data from your research or data related to your research, address a simple analysis (statistical, plot) using a software package of your choice. Provide whatever files are necessary, including the raw data, and enough supporting information to provide a reader with a clear understanding of the data details, the analysis you are addressing, and the results/interpretation of your analysis. Finally, if your workflow includes steps in a point-and-click environment (e.g., Excel), provide some text detailing how you might address the workflow in a scripted (e.g., R, Python) environment. Upload all relevant files to your GitHub repository in the course GitHub Organization using the naming convention: programming_lastName.fileExtension (e.g., programming_Earl.xlsx, programming_Earl.md). Please submit any text files in markdown format and with the .md file extension to facilitate viewing via GitHub.


Grading criteria:

1. well-documented analysis
2. thoughts comparing the approach taken (if not scripted) versus addressing the analysis using a scripted approach
3. the raw data used in the analysis
4. text file(s) in md format
